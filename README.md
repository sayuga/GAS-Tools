# GAS-Tools
Google App Scripts to extend and simplify tasks such as gathering data from Forms and outputting a professional looking report. 

NOTE: These samples are created and maintained as I go needing the features but I do not guarantee that they are 100% fool proof. I do, however, test them to make sure they serve their original purpose. 

Additionally, Some of these scripts are referencial and thus not, complete code. They are meant to be added into existing scripts to add featuers to active script. (I'll eventually attempt to create a library)
